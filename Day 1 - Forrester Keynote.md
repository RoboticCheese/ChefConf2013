# Day 1 - Glen O'Donnell - Forrester Keynote #

* K3PP on Ham
* Big disruptions drive change
* The Cloud!
* Cloud change driven by economic disruption (Wait, we CAN do more with less)
* Complexity increases way faster than manual ability
* There is too much ***unnecessary*** risk in ***traditional*** IT
* If Boeing worked like IT does, we'd all be dead
* Why is the cloud taking off?
    * Less grunt work that gives you no strategic value
* No revolution, only rapid evolution
* Will automation replace my job? Maybe, but resistance is futile.
* Key to automation = trust, fill trust gap
* Be the automator, not the automatee
* If it's your job being automated, you can be the automator
* Sysadmins are dinosaurs
* Only two business I know have "users": IT and drug dealers
* Geeks love change; imposters hate/fear it
* Old colleagues who are still sysadmins are imposters

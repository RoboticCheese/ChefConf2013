# Day 2 - IBM Keynote #

* Managing SmartCloud (OpenStack) with Chef
* IBM has an open source history; not that different from any other company
* Mainframes -> WebSphere -> SmartCloud
* "Our cloud will benefit from renewed push to open source"
* "Who says elephants can't fly?"
    * The elephant in the room is all this data on paper and in disparate systems with no way to tie it together
* Coming Soon from Chef:
    * AIX client
    * SmartCloud
    * WebSphere cookbooks
